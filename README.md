# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to leverage SQLite and SQLAlchemy to create sql engines on local servers to conduct queries that analyzed key weather trends for a new app for a surf shop

## Results
After conducting this analysis, there are some key data trends to highlight:
- Overall, the average temperature is warmer in June (~75) compared to Dec (~71)
- June also has a larger sample size of temperatures (~1700), which means the data can be described as more reliable and accurate with more data to analyze compared to Dec (~1500)
- Lastly, while December is often deemed a 'cold' month, the hotest day (83) of the month was only 2 degrees cooler than June (85) which is considered part of the 'Summer' months
